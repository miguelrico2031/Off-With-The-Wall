**Off with the Wall** is a Clicker game where your goal is to start a revolution and gather as many followers as possible to achieve a single objective: destroy the Wall.


The Wall divides the city into two zones: the ugly, impoverished zone where people live in squalor, and the rich zone where those who exploit the hard work of the people live in luxury.


Several main characters accompany you on your mission. They will often propose plans to gain followers or seek your advice. Your decisions (and a bit of luck) will impact the revolution, for better or worse.


Throughout the game, various events will occur in the city. These events will affect your revolution and often involve characters: allies or enemies.


When you believe you have enough manpower in your revolution, feel free to click on the Wall to attempt to bring it down. If you fail, you will lose people among your ranks, as the police are cruel and unforgiving. However, if you succeed, Off with the Wall!
