    Text: So you want to try to get all the NOMBRECOSA people together and try to
      tear down the wall? I think it's pretty risky, actually. If it goes wrong,
      the police will come and it will be a huge battle, we will lose a lot of people.
      But it's up to you, if you want to take the risk now, or wait until we have
      more people in the cause...
