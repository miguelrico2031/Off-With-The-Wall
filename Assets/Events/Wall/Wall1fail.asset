    Text: "*NOMBRECOSA\u2019s attempt to tear down the wall is prevented by the police*
      This well known group of terrorists attempted, as strange as it may sound,
      to tear down the city wall. This act of vandalism and terrorism was, fortunately,
      prevented by the police, who violently dispersed this act, causing casualties
      on both sides, but ending in a clear defeat for NOMBRECOSA.\r"
