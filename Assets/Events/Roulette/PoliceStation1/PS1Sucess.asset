    Text: "*Anti-police graffiti inspires hatred on the streets* After the police
      station was covered in anti-police graffiti overnight, the population has expressed
      their support for the cause, with protests and demonstrations on the rise.
      It's a shame they appreciate graffiti so much and books so little, if it were
      the other way around, there wouldn't be any \u201Csocialcommunism\u201D in
      this fine city."
