    Text: "*From activist to councilor*. The new counselors for the municipal government
      have been revealed. In a surprising turn of events, the leader of the organization
      \u201CA Better Tomorrow\u201D has been elected as a counselor. We hope this
      will mean a decrease in violent acts and radical protests.\r\nIn addition,
      the new counselor has announced that the organization will stop doing rallies
      and demonstrations against the government.\r\n"

      that piece of shit.\r\n"
