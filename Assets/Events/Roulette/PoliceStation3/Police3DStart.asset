    Text: "Hey, I don't know if you remember me. I'm the cop who wants to screw every
      cop in this town. I've come up with a plan, somewhat risky but very rewarding.
      I've been assigned as a patrolman, to alert of manifestations and congregations
      of \u201Csuspicious\u201D people in public spaces. How about I make a false
      alarm, alerting of a very dangerous protest, and ask for support from all available
      units. That would leave the police station practically empty, and a mob of
      NOMBRECOSA people could enter and destroy it.\r\n"

    Text: "Sorry to intrude, but I couldn't help but overhear this guy's plan, and
      as tempting as it sounds, we don't know him at all, and it could be a police
      trap to weaken us. Besides, wouldn't it be too risky for you, Mr. \u201Cgood
      cop\u201D? They will kill you when they find out you betrayed them.\r\n"

    Text: 'I have it in mind. My plan is to escape, and finally get the hell out
      of this rotten city. I''ve been wanting to do it for a long time, but I want
      to do a good deed for once, before I leave.
