    Text: '*Attempted assault on the police station foiled* Once again the police
      triumphed against the NOMBRECOSA coup plotters, who tried to storm the police
      station armed with crowbars and bats. According to sources close to the police,
      the terrorist communist organization had an infiltrator inside the police,
      who was going to help them distract most of the agents, but the operation went
      wrong due to the lack of credibility of the infiltrator.
