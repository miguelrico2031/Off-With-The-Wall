    Text: "Hey! So, guess what? We caught this undercover cop snooping around, pretending
      to be one of us. We beat the shit out of him, and now he's being held in a
      safe house. I was thinking, why not organize a protest in the square tonight?
      And, when the cops show up, let's give them a little surprise. I don't want
      to give away too much, but trust me on this one\u2026\r"
