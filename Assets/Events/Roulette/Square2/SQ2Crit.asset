    Text: "*Brutal Protest Leads to Police Retreat: NOMBRECOSA Member's Act of Cannibalism
      Shocks Authorities* In a shocking turn of events, a known member of NOMBRECOSA
      was witnessed biting off a portion of an undercover officer's face during yesterday's
      protest. This act deeply shook the morale of the police force, with many officers
      abandoning their posts out of fear. However, some were so impressed by that
      deranged man\u2019s determination that they resigned from the force and joined
      NOMBRECOSA. It's a real shame that nowadays not even the police are trustworthy,
      apparently."
