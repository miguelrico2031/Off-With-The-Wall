      Officer''s Face* Yesterday''s protest took a gruesome turn as a known member
      of NOMBRECOSA, was seen biting off a chunk of an undercover officer''s face
      in front of the crowd. Police responded with force, resulting in numerous casualties
      among the protesters. However, and unfortunately, this brutal act has inspired
      many to join the cause.'
