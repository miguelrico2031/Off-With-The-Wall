    Text: '*A group of citizens was attacked from the sky by a flock of pigeons*
      The group, apparently vandals, had embarked on an unusual bird-hunting campaign
      with an unknown objective. It is hoped that the birds have taught the would-be
      hunters a lesson.

      we have several casualties... Apparently, they\u2019ve upgraded the hardware
      on those birds, and now they\u2019re equipped with more dangerous weapons.
      We couldn\u2019t stand a chance against them.\r\n"
