    Text: '*Bird attack in police station*.  A flock of rabid pigeons attack local
      police officers. It is suspected that the birds were bribed with bread crumbs
      and cookies by some conspiracy theorist  mob. Our city heroes are now being
      treated and recovering from the attack.

    Text: "Have you read the latest news? We made it! The plan didn't go as expected,
      but we surely helped the cause. We managed to talk with the \u201Cbirds\u201D
      and bribed them with some leftover bread. They seemed pretty satisfied and
      have joined the cause! They complained about how the government only treated
      them as drones and didn\u2019t put much attention to their happiness."

    Text: "If you ask me, I was a little bit frightened when I saw the level of self
      awareness these robot birds have acquired in the last few years\u2026 But they
      are on our side now!... I hope. At least as long as we have enough bread for
      them.\r\n\r\n"
