    Text: '*Illegal barbecue in main square*. A group of hunters has held an illegal
      barbecue in the plaza. The smell of fried pigeon is wafting through the streets.
      The police have been unable to arrest the cooks due to fears of contracting
      some disease.'

    Text: 'Everything went well! Well... the hunt went well. It turns out the drones
      have been upgraded for increased realism and now even have flesh and blood!
      It''s impressive how robotics are advancing these days... Anyway, we had a
      delicious barbecue with the drones we managed to catch, and the smell of the
      roast attracted some citizens who are now interested in the cause!
