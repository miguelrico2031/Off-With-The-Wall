    Text: '*Tragedy at FuckDonalds: socialist/terrorist attack leaves workers dead*
      A bomb exploded inside the fast-food restaurant FuckDonalds, causing the death
      of several employees. It''s suspected that the attack was carried out by a
      group of members of NOMBRECOSA. The city is shocked by the incident. It seems
      like these lefties just want to sow chaos, regardless of the innocent lives
      they take.'
