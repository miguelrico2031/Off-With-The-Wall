    Text: '*FuckDonalds reduced to rubble by socialist/terrorist attack* The famous
      fast-food restaurant FuckDonalds was completely obliterated by an explosion.
      It''s suspected that the attack was carried out by members of NOMBRECOSA. Incredibly,
      the place was evacuated minutes before the incident, thanks to an anonymous
      warning. Authorities are investigating.'

      explosion!  It was beautiful... And luckily, I remembered to tell the employees
      to get the hell out, so there were no casualties!"
