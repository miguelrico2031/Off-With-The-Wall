      I can\u2019t believe they try to make us celebrate our own oppression. But
      it is an opportunity to really shake things up-\r\nI think we should try to
      hold the biggest protest we\u2019ve done yet.\r\n"

    Text: "As a representative of  \u201CA Better Tomorrow\u201D I couldn\u2019t
      disagree more. \u201CWall Day\u201D does not represent our oppression, it is
      a celebration of our country. We shouldn\u2019t try to cause chaos on such
      a relevant day, it would only be detrimental for our organizations. \r\n"
