    Text: "Of course yes! Why didn\u2019t I think of that! We should use the tunnels!
      \nYou know, the secret underground tunnels that connect the town hall with
      the inside of the wall? Everybody knows about them! \r\n\r\n"

    Text: 'They say years ago there was a massive protest that blocked the entrance
      to the town hall, but the mayor was able to go back to the wall without being

      to notice me.
