    Text: Hey, comrades, I've got some info to share. Back when I was a manager at
      Fuck Donalds, I used to have access to some privileged intel. Turns out, once
      a month, a truck loaded with burgers heads over the wall. The reason? A special
      order for the elitist monthly golf club meeting.

    Text: 'Seems like these guys not only enjoy whacking balls on the course, but
      also indulging in Big Fucks while they''re at it. How about we seize this opportunity
      to hit the system right where it hurts and redistribute all that food among
      the city folks?
