    Text: '*NOMBRECOSA criminals get what they deserve* A group of communist delinquents
      attempted to hijack a Fuck Donalds truck, only to be surprised by a group of
      law enforcement agents inside instead of burgers. It turned out to be an undercover
      operation to arrest several members of this criminal anarchist group. Who knows
      how they''ll fare in prison talking about revolutions.'

    Text: I'm sorry to have betrayed you, but who needs ideals when you can make
      money!? In this cruel world, being individualistic is the only way to survive!
      Hehehe... Until next time, comrade.
