    Text: '*Brainwashed students set fire to the school* The city''s only school
      fell victim to a fire caused by a group of students from NOMBRECOSA. Once again,
      it''s shown that the left hates intellectuality and critical thinking, and
      only wants uneducated people who swallow their revolution lies.'
