    Text: "We the students from NOMBRECOSA are fucking fed up with the school! We've
      talked about it and we think we should burn it down. It's a factory of brainless
      sheep without critical thinking where they only teach us capitalist ideas:
      in economics they tell us that a company\u2019s value is created by  the entrepreneur,
      not the workpower;"

    Text: " in history, they make us believe that we should be grateful to the government
      because it provides a \u201Cwelfare state\u201D that protects everyone, when
      we fucking know it only protects the interests of big companies. Burning down
      the school and educating ourselves freely is the only option!\r"

    Text: "I am also from NOMBRECOSA, and burning the school would be a \u201Cruin\u201D,
      as you youngsters say. We teachers would lose our jobs, and besides, there
      are many of us who are aligned with the cause and are trying to teach students
      about the system's flaws and promote critical thinking."
