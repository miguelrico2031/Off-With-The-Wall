    Text: "*SERIOUS WEAPON ROBBERY IN POLICE STATION* Yesterday, several weapons
      were stolen from the police station weaponry. The identity of the perpetrator
      remains unknown. Here at the newspaper, we hope that the higher zones of the
      city will supply the station with new and better weapons. \r\n"
