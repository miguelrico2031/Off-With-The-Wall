    Text: "Hey, how's it going? Not sure if you saw the fight in the plaza yesterday.
      Looks like those damn cops went overboard again with the first homeless folks
      they found. We have to do something. No matter how much we disagree with police
      brutality, if we don't act, you and me, we\u2019ll all go down in history with
      a sad statue of liberty as a generation that didn't agree. What is in us that
      turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering?\r\n"

    Text: 'You know, I''m a somewhat recognized artist in the city... I might be
      able to sneak into the police station and steal some of the few weapons those
      fucking cops use to patrol our neighborhood. The folks at the place know me;
      they don''t like me, but they know I have some media power, so they probably
      won''t give me much trouble. As a recognized artist, I''d love to use my influence
      to help the cause.

      I doubt the rich district will send any new weapons
      to this area.
