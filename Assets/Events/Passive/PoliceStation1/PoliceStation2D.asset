    Text: "Hey\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t be here speaking to you, I hope the other cops
      don\u2019t see us together. I just wanted to say I hate being a fucking pig,
      I hate licking the boot of this oppressive government and abusing my authority
      to torment the weak, unlike my colleagues who seem to love it."

    Text: "That makes me sick, goddamnit! You can count on me if you need eyes and
      ears inside the police force. I want to help the cause, and I wish nothing
      other than to see those motherfuckers in the same position they put innocent
      people in day after day.\r"
