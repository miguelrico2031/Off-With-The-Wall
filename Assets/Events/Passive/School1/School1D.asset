    Text: '*Student Protesters Get What They Deserve* Yesterday''s student demonstration
      against the government was successfully dispersed by the police. Although the
      protest was peaceful, several students vandalized city spaces with horrible
      graffiti, so the police had no choice but to resort to violence and arrest
      several protesters.
