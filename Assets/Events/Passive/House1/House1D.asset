    Text: "*City Treasury Plundered* This morning, the city woke up to the sad news
      that half of the funds in the treasury have disappeared. Our beloved city treasurer
      has refused to give a statement, and authorities have the known criminals of
      NOMBRECOSA as the prime suspects. In other news, the city treasurer unveils
      a new yacht, and a new security system in his mansion\u2026"

      the chance. Now that guy is unreachable, and he's back to stealing from our
      pockets again, to buy himself a big ass boat.\r"

    Text: "A lot of our people found out we had that bastard and let him go, and
