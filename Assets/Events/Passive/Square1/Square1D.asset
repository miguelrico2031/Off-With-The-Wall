    Text: "*So-called \"musicians\" incite violence and destruction* Last night,
      an illegal underground concert by NOMBREVVV took place, a group attempting
      to pose as musicians, presenting their incendiary propaganda as songs. Their
      lyrics, such as \"Our last mission is to die killing, to murder the high command\"
      or \u201CHow much the hood has changed, we ought to blow it up and build it
      again on top of the blood of those who took it from us\u201D are deeply troubling
      and horrendous. Despite this, their music appears to resonate with youth, who
      seem to be keen on putting these songs into practice\u2026\r\n"
